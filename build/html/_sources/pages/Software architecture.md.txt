# 2. Software architecture

We will use the C4 model to expose the software architecture. Thus, in the description of this section we will differentiate between:

- Level 1: A **System Context** diagram provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.
- Level 2: A **Container** diagram zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks.
- Level 3: A **Component** diagram zooms into an individual container, showing the components inside it.
- Level 4: A **code** (e.g. UML class) diagram can be used to zoom into an individual component, showing how that component is implemented.
